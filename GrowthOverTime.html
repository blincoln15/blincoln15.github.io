Explore the Global Dataset of Historical Yield (GDHYv1.2+v1.3)
Dive into the comprehensive Global Dataset of Historical Yield (GDHYv1.2+v1.3), a rich resource offering annual time series data on the yield estimates of key crops—maize, rice, wheat, and soybean—across the globe. 
  Spanning from 1981 to 2016, this dataset presents high-resolution, 0.5-degree grid-cell data in t/ha units, derived from satellite-based vegetation indices and FAO-reported country yield statistics. 
  With detailed seasonal breakdowns, including "major" and "secondary" growing seasons for maize and rice, and "winter" and "spring" for wheat, the dataset provides nuanced insights into global agricultural patterns.
  By combining satellite-derived data and established country statistics, GDHY ensures reliable continuity in its time series, particularly in its "aligned version" covering 2011-2016. 
  Explore how changing geographic and temporal factors affect agricultural productivity and gain valuable insights for research, policy, and global food security planning.
